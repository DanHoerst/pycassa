    """Ensure basic interface compliance for an instance or dict of callables.

    Checks that ``obj`` implements public methods of ``cls`` or has members
    listed in ``methods``.  If ``required`` is not supplied, implementing at
    least one interface method is sufficient.  Methods present on ``obj`` that
    are not in the interface are ignored.

    If ``obj`` is a dict and ``dict`` does not meet the interface
    requirements, the keys of the dictionary are inspected. Keys present in
    ``obj`` that are not in the interface will raise TypeErrors.

    Raises TypeError if ``obj`` does not meet the interface criteria.

    In all passing cases, an object with callable members is returned.  In the
    simple case, ``obj`` is returned as-is; if dict processing kicks in then
    an anonymous class is returned.

    obj
      A type, instance, or dictionary of callables.
    cls
      Optional, a type.  All public methods of cls are considered the
      interface.  An ``obj`` instance of cls will always pass, ignoring
      ``required``..
    methods
      Optional, a sequence of method names to consider as the interface.
    required
      Optional, a sequence of mandatory implementations. If omitted, an
      ``obj`` that provides at least one interface method is considered
      sufficient.  As a convenience, required may be a type, in which case
      all public methods of the type are required.
